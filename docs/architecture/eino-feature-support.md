# Eino Feature Support

This document is the maintained capability and verification matrix for the
CloudWeGo Eino dependency. It replaces the planning inventory that produced the
v0.9.19 adoption and is updated whenever a package of that adoption lands.

## Pin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Module | `github.com/cloudwego/eino` |
| Version | `v0.9.19` (exact, no `replace`) |
| Origin | `https://github.com/cloudwego/eino` at `9d983b36a5112a1c233056b1a099825298fafb8f` (`refs/tags/v0.9.19`) |
| Module checksum | `h1:i71YUBK3nwY4L53dkzRgZpAcPSZ4v4eRponN7W9sDtk=` |
| Guard | `internal/deps/eino_pin_test.go` asserts the exact version, the absence of a replacement and the `go.sum` line |

The nested modules `wasmext/gen`, `examples/wasm-extensions` and
`internal/tools` do not consume Eino and were not changed by the pin.

Previous pin `v0.8.13` compiled unchanged against `v0.9.19`. One existing test
changed behavior: `schema.ToolInfo` now marshals `ParamsOneOf` natively and
distinguishes the parameter-map form from the JSON-schema form, so the
protected tool-info comparison in `runtime/extension_tool.go` compares the
converted schema separately from the remaining fields.

## W1: durable interception proof

Status: passed. The proof lives in `runtime/adk_proof_test.go`,
`runtime/adk_approval_proof_test.go`, `runtime/adk_boundary_test.go`,
`runtime/adk_recovery_test.go`, `runtime/adk_turnloop_test.go`,
`runtime/adk_approval_test.go` and `runtime/adk_wrapping_test.go`. It uses the
real upstream `adk.TypedChatModelAgent[*schema.AgenticMessage]`,
`adk.TypedRunner`, `compose.AgenticToolsNode`, checkpoint protocol,
`adk.TurnLoop`, retry and failover wrappers, and `adk.NewTypedAgentTool`, with a
scripted `model.AgenticModel`, SQLite and the existing fenced execution store.
It is test-only scaffolding: W5 promotes the proven adapters into the runtime
and deletes the scaffolding while keeping the regression tests.

Verified invariants (each is an executable assertion, run with `-race -count=10`):

- Every physical model call, including retries, failover attempts and child
  agent dispatches, creates one model request ledger row before dispatch and
  settles it completed or failed afterwards.
- The model result is committed (text and reasoning parts, canonical pending
  tool-call records, finalized assistant message) before ADK emits the model
  event, in both generate and streaming mode. The scaffolding drains the
  provider stream to EOF, concatenates chunks carrying `StreamingMeta.Index`
  with `schema.ConcatAgenticMessages`, and republishes one committed chunk;
  no live delta reaches ADK. Live transport of deltas is W3/W7 work. Results
  containing any block kind the scaffolding cannot record (server, MCP,
  tool-search and generated media blocks) fail closed before ADK sees them.
- ADK schedules function calls but only the durable adapter executes them:
  claim under the run fence, the existing permission policy (a real
  `permissions.Policy` asking and denying settles `expected_failure` rows
  without running the executor) and the settlement pipeline, then the settled
  output is the only model-visible and event-visible result. Replayed
  terminal rows are checked against the current run and session.
- A tool interrupt (`compose.StatefulInterrupt` from the tool) produces a real
  ADK checkpoint that is written before the interrupt event reaches the
  consumer. After closing and reopening SQLite under a new run fence, a
  targeted `ResumeWithParams` executes only the addressed leaf; settled
  siblings are never re-executed; a call left `running` by a crashed process
  is settled interrupted without rerun; a call settled after a stale
  checkpoint replays its recorded output without running the executor.
- An untargeted resume keeps the leaf paused, checkpoints again and dispatches
  nothing. Stale fences and competing live claims are rejected. A runner
  checkpoint `Set` failure emits an error event and still emits the interrupt
  event, so public pause promotion requires the interrupt and an error-free
  drain, never the interrupt alone.
- Cancellation: before dispatch produces no ledger row; `CancelAfterChatModel`
  commits the model result and checkpoints without running tools;
  `CancelAfterToolCalls` settles the tool then checkpoints; immediate
  cancellation during a tool ends the run with a `CancelError`.
- `adk.TurnLoop` runs two successive turns under one live run fence with
  distinct assistant messages and ledger rows, without settling the run. The
  outer store is written only at loop exit, after `OnAgentEvents` returned and
  before `Wait` returns; a failed outer `Set` is reported through
  `TurnLoopExitState.CheckpointErr` without a promoted checkpoint; a
  between-turn stop checkpoints only the queue and is replanned through
  `GenInput`, not `GenResume`; a clean idle exit writes no checkpoint and
  retires a loaded one; a preempting push cancels only the captured turn.
- A completed model result carrying `MCPToolApprovalRequest` pauses at the
  model boundary through `compose.StatefulInterrupt`, before the ReAct loop can
  schedule sibling function calls, in generate and streaming mode and with a
  retry wrapper configured. The approval record is durable; resume after
  reopen updates it once under the run fence, dispatches exactly one
  continuation whose input
  is the original input, the committed transcript and the user-role
  `MCPToolApprovalResponse` bound to the request ID, and a duplicate decision
  cannot dispatch again. Approval-only results also pause instead of
  completing normally.
- Middleware-added tools cannot evade settlement: the model adapter refuses
  calls to tools outside the frozen registry, and a last-registered
  `BeforeAgent` handler wraps registry tools injected by earlier middleware.

Findings that shape later packages:

- `model_requests` is unique on `(run, attempt, step)`. Concurrent adapters on
  one run (child agents, failover models) and resumed processes must draw
  from one per-run invocation sequence; W5 introduces an explicit invocation
  identity as planned.
- SQL stores return an unsettled call's absent output as JSON `null`.
  `settleInterruptedTool` now treats `null` as absent so interrupted
  settlements carry a real bounded output.
- Executed sibling tools are served from the ADK checkpoint state on resume;
  SQL remains authoritative when the checkpoint is stale.
- Eino mints a fresh UUID interrupt ID on every pause and re-pause, while the
  `InterruptCtx.Address` (for example `agent:proof;tool:gate:call-9`) is the
  stable identity. `ResumeWithParams` with an ID that no longer resolves is a
  silent no-op re-pause. Public pause identity in W5 must therefore be the
  address or a durable runtime record that is resolved to the current
  interrupt ID from the freshly loaded checkpoint at resume time, and native
  approval IDs remain distinct from both.
- The scaffolding's ledger uses attempt `1` for every dispatch and a shared
  per-run step sequence, so the `attempt` axis of the unique index is inert
  until W5 defines invocation identity; audited safe call configuration
  covers temperature, top-p, max tokens, stop and tool choice only.
- Upstream retry and failover wrappers only recognize graph-level interrupt
  errors (`compose.ExtractInterruptInfo`); a `compose.StatefulInterrupt`
  returned by the model itself is treated as an ordinary failure by the
  deprecated `IsRetryAble` path and re-dispatched. Host-provided
  `ShouldRetry`/`ShouldFailover` decisions must refuse errors matched by
  `compose.IsInterruptRerunError`; the proof covers both guarded wrappers and
  the unguarded hazard.
- The approval record's decision is a read-then-update under the run fence
  and an in-process mutex, not a store-level conditional write; W2/W5 give
  the typed content contract a conditional update.
- The `TypedChatModelAgent` doc comment describes the agentic variant as
  single-shot, but v0.9.19 builds an agentic ReAct graph with a real
  `AgenticToolsNode`; local function tools do execute.
- The runner writes the checkpoint before sending the interrupt event, so
  public pause promotion must wait for the iterator to drain.

## W2: durable ordered rich content

Status: landed (commits 0574474, 3865683, 5b2922f); dual review applied.

- `session/content.go` is the versioned public content contract: 20 block
  kinds string-identical to Eino's `ContentBlockType`, closed typed payloads,
  a public response-meta projection, bounds (8 MiB per message, 1024 blocks,
  1 MiB per block by default, configurable through
  `runtime.WithContentLimits`), strict canonical decoding (unknown fields,
  duplicate keys, trailing values and unknown kinds are rejected) and exact
  conversion to and from `schema.AgenticMessage`. Content that validates is
  always projectable back to Eino.
- Private material (reasoning signatures, Claude encrypted citation indexes,
  Gemini SDK blobs, provider response and continuation IDs, `Extra`,
  `Extension`) is split into block-addressed `PrivateBlockState` and never
  enters public parts; provider-state envelopes and items carry a `BlockID`.
- Parts: one part per block with the block kind as `PartKind`, plus one
  `response_meta` part per assistant message; block parts need strictly
  increasing ordinals so provider-state parts may interleave. Both SQL
  baselines accept the new kinds; schema fingerprints were regenerated;
  observation text is projected from user and assistant text kinds only.
- Store contract: every kind and every nested function-result variant round
  trips through SQLite and PostgreSQL, including a close/reopen of the SQLite
  file, mixed ordering with response meta, observation exclusion of non-text
  kinds, and a provider-state sentinel scan in verbatim and base64 forms.
  The PostgreSQL required-suite list names every new subtest.
- History: `history.ProjectAgentic`/`LoadAgentic` project durable parts into
  agentic messages with `BlockRef` to part identity; legacy kinds map into
  agentic form; the classic projector understands the new kinds, projects
  user media into multi-content input and fails with `ErrClassicUnsupported`
  on anything it cannot represent.
- Admission: `runtime.UserMessage` is ordered content blocks
  (`runtime.TextUserMessage` for text). Block and part IDs are runtime-owned,
  caller-supplied block IDs are rejected, the submission is deep-cloned before
  validation, and every block part is persisted atomically with the run.
  Media-only submissions are admitted and a session that started with media
  continues on later turns.

Superseded part kinds (`text`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `file`, `step`,
`state`) remain declared until the runtime cutover replaces the assistant
persistence path in W3/W5.
